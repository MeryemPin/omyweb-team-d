                    In this digital age, it is easy to feel like the marketing goal is to
                    connect with as many potential new customers as possible to increase
                    your sales. However, there is a lot to be said for nurturing close
                    relationships with your existing customers. In this blog post, we will
                    explore how nurturing customer relationships through 'relationship
                    marketing' is a cost-effective and sustainable way of helping your
                    business to grow, thrive, and blossom in the long term. Why putting
                    people first matters Traditional, transactional marketing focuses
                    purely on increasing your business' leads. But while a customer may
                    choose your brand on one occasion, if they don't have a strong
                    emotional connection to your business, they may not become a returning
                    customer. By focusing on the people who love your business, you can
                    better understand how your audience uses your products and services.
                    In doing so you can work out how you can meet your customers' needs
                    and further strengthen the relationship.

                    <li class="number">
                      <h4> Get to know your customers</h4>
                      <p>
                        Understanding your target audience is key to any marketing
                        strategy, but it is especially important to nurturing
                        relationships. Trying to understand why your customers are
                        interested in your products and services will help to inform your
                        marketing efforts. As a starting point, get to know your
                        customers.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="number">
                      <h4> Engage on social media</h4>
                      <p>
                        Responding quickly to comments or direct messages is key to
                        nurturing customer relationships. Having a direct conversation
                        over social media can significantly influence a customer's
                        impression of your business. When you show that you are attentive
                        to a customer's needs, this will boost their trust and respect for
                        your brand. Taking on board feedback on social media of any kind
                        can bring you key marketing insights. For example, perhaps your
                        customers love the idea of a Mother's Day hamper but would like a
                        cheaper option to suit their price point. Moreover, dealing with
                        any complaints quickly can save your relationship with a customer.
                        By closely listening to your customers, you demonstrate that you
                        respect their opinions. Your business goals will be guided by the
                        people who matter most.

                      <h4>Nurture relationships with content marketing</h4>
                      <p>
                        While you might think of blog posts and email newsletters mainly
                        as tools for bringing in new customers, producing high-quality
                        content for your existing customers will help to keep them
                        emotionally engaged with your business. As you learn more about
                        your customers over time, you can tailor your content to be more
                        relevant. Your content should aim to show customers how to get
                        more out of your products and services and attempt to connect them
                        to the face behind your brand. Some examples of content you can
                        use in relationship marketing that would add value for your
                        existing customers include:
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            How-to videos or blogs helping your customers to get the most
                            out of your products.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Behind-the-scenes previews into the day-to-day running of your
                            business. This can help to form a more personal connection
                            between customer and brand.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Employee introductions: showing your customers the faces
                            behind the business shows that you are human.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Success stories: have you won an award, or achieved something
                            amazing for a client? Let your customers know.
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                        Sharing organic content like this will inspire customers to return
                        to your business, by keeping you at the forefront of their minds.

                      <h4>Relationship marketing via email</h4>
                      <p>
                        While interacting with your customers through social media is
                        highly important, email marketing allows you to reach your most
                        loyal customers on a regular basis. Though you are competing for
                        attention with the other dozens of emails a customer may receive,
                        you are facing far less competition than you are with a social
                        media post, which is competing with an endless number of other
                        posts.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Email marketing is a great way to deliver personalized content to
                        your loyal customers. Email marketing automation platforms like
                        MailChimp allow you to segment your subscriber list into smaller
                        sections. This allows you to deliver more relevant content
                        tailored to the specific interests of different demographics in
                        your audience. If you do not have the time to create an email
                        marketing strategy yourself, you may want to look into enlisting
                        an email marketing agency's services. Automated emails are another
                        great way to keep customers engaged, as they are highly responsive
                        to customer activity.
                      </p>

                    <li class="number">
                      <h4>Show your customers that you value their opinions</h4>
                      <p>
                        While listening to your customers on social media will provide you
                        with an impression of what they think of your brand, you don't
                        have to wait for comments to roll in to get valuable customer
                        feedback. Instead, reach out to your customers for feedback in the
                        form of surveys and reviews. Surveys can form part of your email
                        marketing strategy, or you could promote them via social media.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Keep your surveys short and to the point to maximize customer
                        participation. Decide exactly what you want to learn from
                        customers, and base your questions around this. On a smaller
                        scale, Instagram Stories has many features that allow you to
                        gather opinions quickly and easily, such as polls, Q&A, and quiz
                        stickers. Collecting opinions in this informal manner can allow
                        you to connect with customers on a more regular basis, but bear in
                        mind that it can be. To sum it all up, nurturing clients can not
                        only preserve your loyal customers, but also bring lots of hidden
                        benefits to your business.
