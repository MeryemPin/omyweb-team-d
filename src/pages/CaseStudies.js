                        <b>Sunny Sands</b> tour agency in Barcelona wanted to restore their website. The agency specializes in family tours with children.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <b>Redesign Challenges:</b>
                       The previous website did not highlight the quality of what the tour company offered. As a result, the company was not receiving any website leads. Sunny Sands has a great reputation, however, travelers could not find the website in web searches. Even if they did, the site did not reflect the quality and experience of that reputation. In summary, they needed a website and an ongoing marketing plan to better reflect that quality and success.
                        Tour company had several needs when it came to this website redesign project:
                        </p>
                        <ul >
                        <li>A website that would highlight the quality service for families.</li>
                        <li>An interactive website to attract customers.</li>
                        <li>A best tour portfolio.</li>
                        <li>Company’s positioning and building trust with the company’s brand.</li>
                        <p> <b>What solutions did omYweb come up with?</b> </p>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                        <li>We worked closely with the team to understand their vision. As a result, we created a simply organized beautiful website that reflects the company. </li>
                            <li>An extensive portfolio of top rated family tours attracted new customers. </li>
                            <li>Our team highlighted the company’s quality promise and focused on awards thus higher quality leads. </li>
                            <li>The WordPress website redesign was launched within 8 weeks. </li>
                            <li>Our in-house writing team provided a copy. As a result, improved the site’s overall search engine ranking. </li>
                            <li>We improved the company’s overall brand, hence more engagement on the website and social. </li>
                            <li>Our local agency continues to provide ongoing digital marketing services.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In conclusion, this was a really successful project that we are extremely proud of. The company is immediately seeing quality website leads and increased engagement. In the long run, these results will prove to be exponential. </p>
